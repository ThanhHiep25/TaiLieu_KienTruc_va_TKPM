# JDepend

## What Is It?

JDepend traverses Java class and source file directories and generates design quality metrics for each Java package. JDepend allows you to automatically measure the quality of a design in terms of its extensibility, reusability, and maintainability to effectively manage and control package dependencies.

## Installation and Documentation

Documentation is available in HTML format, in the docs/ directory. For the installation and user manual, see docs/JDepend.html. For the API documentation, see docs/api/index.html.

Thanks for using JDepend!
